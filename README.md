# Final Project 5 — Deep Learning (Spring 2025)
This repository contains all deliverables and source code for our Deep Learning final project for the Spring 2025 course taught by Professor Martin Hagan. The project applies deep learning techniques to solve a real-world problem using a custom-trained neural network implemented in TensorFlow

## Project Description
This project implements a lightweight, multi-label road object detector optimized for deployment on microcontrollers. Targeting seven key road-related classes from the COCO dataset, the model is trained in TensorFlow and converted to TensorFlow Lite Micro for execution on the SparkFun Thing Plus RP2040. It integrates an ArduCAM OV5642 for JPEG image capture and a 128×32 OLED display for real-time output. Designed for efficient, on-device inference, this system enables responsive object detection in constrained environments, supporting the advancement of TinyML applications in intelligent transportation systems.
